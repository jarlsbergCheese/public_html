- **Recipe Name:** Creamy Tomato and Basil Pasta with Burrata

- **Prep Time:** 15 minutes

- **Cook Time:** 20 minutes

- **Servings:** 4

- **Ingredients:**

    * 1 pound pasta (penne, rigatoni, or your favorite shape)
    * 2 tablespoons olive oil
    * 3 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
    * 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
    * 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    * 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
    * 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
    * Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    * 1/2 cup heavy cream
    * 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    * 8 ounces fresh burrata cheese, drained
    * 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped


- **Instructions:**

    1. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
    2. **Saut√© the garlic:** While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
    3. **Simmer the sauce:** Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.
    4. **Add cream and cheese:** Stir in the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese. Reduce heat to low and simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to meld the flavors.
    5. **Combine pasta and sauce:** Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.
    6. **Serve:** Divide the pasta among four bowls. Top each serving with a generous dollop of burrata cheese and sprinkle with fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately.


- **Tips:**

    * For a richer flavor, use high-quality canned tomatoes. San Marzano tomatoes are a great choice.
    * If you don't have fresh burrata, you can substitute with fresh mozzarella.
    * Feel free to adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to your liking.
    * A sprinkle of extra Parmesan cheese on top adds a nice touch.
    *  For a vegetarian option, omit the burrata and add a handful of roasted vegetables such as zucchini or bell peppers to the sauce.
    *  To make this a complete meal, serve with a side salad of mixed greens and a crusty Italian bread.
